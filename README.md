# Hello, welcome to my challenge's repository

Simply put, each folder is a project initialized created using CRA.

All you need to do is to run the 'npm i' command on the desired folder (project) to install all necessary dependencies.

After that you can run the 'npm start' script on the desired folder and voila, the project will be up and running.

# "Why didn't you keep the projects into just one folder?" You may ask

Well, if it was a real project, surely I'd do it, but to let everything clearly understandable, I decided to do it, if you think the other way around would be better for you, please let me know!
